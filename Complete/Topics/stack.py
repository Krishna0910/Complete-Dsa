# Problem Statement
# Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is balanced.

# An input string is balanced if:

# Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
# Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.


# Input: s = "()[]{}"
# Output: true

# Input: s = "(]"
# Output: false

# Logic 

# We will create a stack of characters and visit the whole string starting from index 0 to the end.
# If the character is either of the following (, {, or [, we will push it onto the stack.
# If the character is either of the following ), }, or ], then we will pop from the stack. But we will have a separate check for the validation. Letâ€™s understand it by an example.
# Suppose the character is ), then the stack top must be (.
# And this is to be validated for the rest of the two types of brackets also.

# Ques Simplify path

# Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.

# In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.

# The canonical path should have the following format:

# The path starts with a single slash '/'.
# Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
# The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
# The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')                      



# Input: path = "/home//movies/.//./bollywood/../../songs/"
# Output: "/home/songs"
# Explanation: First you entered into home directory, then to movies, after that there is no meaning of "." and "//",
# then you further enterned into bollywood directory and then finally returned back twice by using ".." twice and 
# reached in home. And finally enetered into songs. Hence /home/songs is the answer.




# logic

# if ".." then pop otherwise push

# Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.

# Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

# Note that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

# It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

# Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]

# Ques 
# Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String  


# You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters. A duplicate removal consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters and removing them.

# We repeatedly make duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

# Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It can be proven that the answer is unique.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abbaca"
# Output: "ca"
# Explanation: 
# For example, in "abbaca" we could remove "bb" since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.  
# The result of this move is that the string is "aaca", of which only "aa" is possible, so the final string is "ca".

# Ques 1614. Maximum Nesting Depth of the Parentheses

# A string is a valid parentheses string (denoted VPS) if it meets one of the following:

# It is an empty string "", or a single character not equal to "(" or ")",
# It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are VPS's, or
# It can be written as (A), where A is a VPS.
# We can similarly define the nesting depth depth(S) of any VPS S as follows:

# depth("") = 0
# depth(C) = 0, where C is a string with a single character not equal to "(" or ")".
# depth(A + B) = max(depth(A), depth(B)), where A and B are VPS's.
# depth("(" + A + ")") = 1 + depth(A), where A is a VPS.
# For example, "", "()()", and "()(()())" are VPS's (with nesting depths 0, 1, and 2), and ")(" and "(()" are not VPS's.

# Given a VPS represented as string s, return the nesting depth of s.
